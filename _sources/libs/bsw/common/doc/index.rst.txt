common

Overview
--------

The module common is deprecated. This is why this is just an empty placeholder project.

It only contains `util/concurrent/IFutureSupport.h` as this is required by `async`.

Everything else shall be removed over time! That includes:

- `util/Delegate.h` which is required by `bsp/commandInterpreter`
